## Introduction {#introduction}

These past few weeks, I've been spending most of my free time practicing Rust by building a [small functional programming language called lily](https://github.com/PureFunctor/lily.git). I've decided to write it in said language for two reasons: fun is a mandatory answer, of course, but I really wanted to explore what it's like to write performant programs from scratch in a language and field that I've never really spent much time on.

My experience with C and C++ were often riddled with unsafe and undefined behavior, and I can say for certain that I've been unproductive with these languages. On the other hand, I feel like I'm most productive when I have a direct discourse with the compiler, like I do with Haskell and PureScript.

From what I've seen so far, the Rust compiler `rustc` does an exceptional job at presenting errors to developers. Here's an example of how errors are served by `rustc` during compilation.

```rust
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `arena` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  --> lily-cst/src/lib.rs:71:5
   |
62 |     let interners = Rc::new(Interners::new(&arena));
   |                                            ------ immutable borrow occurs here...
71 |     arena.reset();
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
72 |     println!("{:?}", result);
   |                      ------ immutable borrow later used here
```

That being said, this _loooong_-form blog post is quite different from my previous post, [Free and Cofree]({{< relref "20220228083102-free_and_cofree.md" >}}), as it also serves as a "rolling" mind map while I'm developing the `lily` compiler.
